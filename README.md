## Description

The purpose of this project is to generate a website that acts as a note taker, so that I can record my thoughts and TODO.

In completing this challenge, I learned how to build html and api routes and middleware works, and how uuid works to create independent ids for each note generated by the user. Lastly, the challenge improved my understanding of how filter method works in bonus of deleting notes. 



## Installation 

To use, install npm, inquirer and uuid (version 8.2.4) in VScode or a similiar program

## Usage

open the Heroku server linked below and use the note taker as the user wishes.
